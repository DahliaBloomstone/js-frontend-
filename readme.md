# This is your "Good Deeds" Tracker.

This simple tracker web app is a fun way to track your good deeds. It has a simple, colorful design to make the user excited to add their actions! 

This app even has a retro 90's easy keyboard game to play to bring back some nostalgia while logging their accomplishments. 

The user will be greeted upon entering the site, they can add their deed, delete their deed, and have their deeds sorted alphabetically, which is really fantastic. 

After cloning this repo, be sure to clone the backend as well.
