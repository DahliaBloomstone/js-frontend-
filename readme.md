This is your "Good Deeds" Tracker.

This simple tracker web app is a fun way to track your good deeds. It has a simple, colorful design to make the user excited to add their actions! 

This app even has a retro 90's easy keyboard game to play to bring back some nostalgia while logging their accomplishments. 

This repository is the companion to the backend repo. If you're not familiar with Ruby on Rails, I highly recommend that you go check out that README as well for technology installation instructions.

The user will be greeted upon entering the site, they can add their deed, delete their deed, and have their deeds sorted alphabetically, which is really fun.
